EKS Pod Deployment with ECR Image Pulling

This project provides a simple way to deploy a pod with a service to an EKS cluster, which pulls images from an ECR repository in AWS. The image being pulled from the ECR is a simple web application that shows the hostname and IP of the host. This project can be easily wrapped for your own CI/CD purposes.
Prerequisites

Before you can deploy the pod to your EKS cluster, you'll need the following:

    A running EKS cluster
    Access to an ECR repository in your AWS account
    Jenkins installed with a master and two agent servers
    kubectl command-line tool installed

Setup

Here are the steps you need to follow to set up this project:

   1 Create a GitLab user and repository for the project
   2 Import a public SSH key to the GitHub project to allow accessibility
   3 Upload the project to the GitLab repository
   4 Integrate Jenkins with GitHub webhook and Jenkins GitHub plugin
   5 Run Jenkinsfile from the correct path (usually from the master branch)
   6 Initiate a private repository in ECR
   7 Log in from EC2 agent to ECR with aws get-login-password | docker login to <user-aws-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
   8 Tag the image to <user-aws-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repo>:<tag> and push it. See ECR documentation for more information.
   9 Create an EKS cluster with Node group and assign IAM roles for each entity. The roles for nodes should include AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy 
     and AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly. See the EKS documentation for more information.
  10 Integrate Agents and download kubectl and aws-cli to connect EC2 to EKS
  11 Update kubeconfig
  12 apply podspec.yaml and podservice.yaml to deploy the application to EKS from ECR as a Pod. See the EKS documentation for more information.

This will create the necessary pod and service resources in your EKS cluster. You can customize the podspec.yaml and podservice.yaml files to fit your own needs.
Testing Load Balancer

Once the pod and service resources are created, you can test the LoadBalancer functionality by running the following command:

csharp

kubectl get services

This will output a list of services in your EKS cluster. You can then open a web browser and navigate to https://<load_balancer_dns_name>:443 to see the load balancer in action.
